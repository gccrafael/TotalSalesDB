This program will use a database called SalesDB.  
The application will allow the user to display 
sales information for any customer on file.  
Specifically, the user will select a customer 
from a drop-down list (filled by reading the 
customer file in the database), and after 
selection of a customer the sales records on 
file from the sales_order table (for that customer)
 will be displayed in a JTable below the selection box.
